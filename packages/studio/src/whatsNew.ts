/**
 * What's New — the changelog people actually see, in the editor and on the dashboard.
 *
 * AGENTS: every user-visible change adds an item here, in the same change. A new version goes
 * at the TOP of `RELEASES` (newest first); its `version` must sort after the previous one
 * (YYYY.MM.DD, with a `.2` suffix for a second release on a day). Write items for a person,
 * not a commit log: what they can do now and where to find it. Give an item a `tour` when the
 * feature has a place on screen — its steps point at `data-tour` anchors that exist
 * (whatsNew.test.ts checks every one). See CLAUDE.md → "What's New".
 *
 * What a person has seen is one field, the newest version they closed the panel on:
 * `profiles.last_seen_release` when signed in (the web app wires it with `configureWhatsNew`),
 * localStorage otherwise. Everything newer is shown, from there.
